# Simple-Calligram-Generator
I created this simple, single worded calligram generator to make a reference to Hamilton the musical for my girlfriend.
The Calligram I created was Palaces made of paragraphs, since that's what Hamilton built for Eliza.
This is very much thrown together, as it is my first p5 project, one of my first js projects, and I only spent an hour and a half on it.

Enjoy
